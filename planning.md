# â˜• Coffee Shop POS System

A full-stack point-of-sale (POS) system purpose-built for coffee shop operations. This project serves as both a learning journey and a portfolio piece, demonstrating modern web development practices using **React** for the frontend and **Fastify + Prisma** for the backend.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This system replicates the ordering workflow used in coffee shops, aiming to provide a seamless experience for baristas and customers. Core features include:

- Browsing menu items by category
- Selecting and customizing items (e.g., size, variants)
- Creating and submitting orders
- Handling payments (mock or real)
- Persisting data via PostgreSQL
- API development following REST principles

Implement a lightweight admin panel for shop owners or managers to:

---

### ðŸ’» Phase 5: Hardware Integration

- Optimize the UI for real-world deployment on devices like:
  - iPad or Android tablets

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 6: Stretch Goals

- Support for offline mode (e.g., service worker or local DB cache)
- Authentication and role-based access (barista vs admin)
- Real-time updates via WebSockets or polling
